Regression tests for YAMLless operation
=======================================

Job priorities are not preserved
--------------------------------

Setup a connection that won't parse YAML:

    >>> import beanstalkc
    >>> beanstalk = beanstalkc.Connection(host='localhost', port=14711,
    ...                                   parse_yaml=False)

Observe that YAML is not parsed:

    >>> not isinstance(beanstalk.stats(), dict)
    True

Note that while Job#release and Job#bury will still work, they won't
automatically maintain the released/buried Job's priority:

    >>> jid = beanstalk.put('foo', priority=42)

    >>> job = beanstalk.reserve()
    >>> print(repr(job.stats()))                    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    '...pri: 42...'

    >>> job.release()               # Succeeds, but ...

    >>> job = beanstalk.reserve()   # ... may not do what you want.
    >>> print(repr(job.stats()))                    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    '...pri: 2147483648...'

    >>> job.delete()

Same for Job#bury:

    >>> jid = beanstalk.put('bar', priority=42)

    >>> job = beanstalk.reserve()
    >>> print(repr(job.stats()))                    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    '...pri: 42...'

    >>> job.bury()

    >>> print(repr(beanstalk.stats_job(jid)))       # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    '...pri: 2147483648...'

And that was that.

    >>> beanstalk.close()
